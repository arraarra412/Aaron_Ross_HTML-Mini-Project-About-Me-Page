<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vietnamese congee, or Cháo, is a comforting, savory rice porridge, simmered until creamy, often made with rich chicken or duck broth, and served with various toppings like shredded meat, ginger, herbs (rau răm), and century eggs. It's a versatile comfort food eaten for breakfast (especially to warm up), a light dinner, or as a restorative meal when ill, but it's especially popular during cooler months or Tết (Lunar New Year) as a symbol of family togetherness and a fresh start, offering simple, hearty nourishment.</p>
<p>I first had Conjee a few weeks ago at a Vietnamese holiday party.  It was quite savory, hearty, and had a wonderful richness - cooked via a fried/baked pig head.  It's a wonderful "Holiday Hangover Meal" if imbibing during the holidays is your thing. The dish reminded me of savory dishes from the Caribbean, and my family origins of Trinidad.  Celebrating and sharing both culture and homeland cuisine is one of my favorite aspects of living in NYC, and was a warm welcome after living in the islands of Hawaii for two years (where pork is commonly eaten as well).</p>
